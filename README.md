# OrderedArrayList
LABORATORY FOR STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL

We saw that Java's fancy ArrayLists can do things with any object!
We can have Integer ArrayLists, String ArrayLists, Object ArrayLists and Puppy ArrayLists if Puppy exists as an object!!!!
COME ONE COME ALL, WITH GENERIC TYPES WE CAN HAVE THEM ALL!

We want to do this with our classes! With Generic Types, our code HAS NO LIMITS! Sky's the limit and the sky will be very bountiful indeed.
This is the beautiful power of Generic Types. Consider it a liberalization of our immigration policy towards refugees, but in this case refugees 
are neglected Object types. With Generic Types, we can use not only one but any Object to work with our classes! 

I was initially confused about how we would use Generic Types in real-life code, but my group members told me about the real-life code example of ArrayLists and how ArrayLists employ the use of Generic Types to make the limits of code truly limitless! Thank you.
